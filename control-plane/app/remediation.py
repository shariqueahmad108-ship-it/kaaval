Shared remediation builder — turns any Kaaval finding (CVE or RBAC) into the
explainable "what to do + why it matters + what it maps to" output that is
the product's actual differentiator. Lives next to scoring.py because it is
the same idea applied to the other half of the finding: scoring.py explains
the rank, this module explains the fix.

Benchmark references cite CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.12.0 (verified 2026-07)
by exact control ID. Rules with no CIS control (e.g. exec/attach grants) cite
the Kubernetes RBAC Good Practices doc and OWASP Kubernetes Top 10 instead —
